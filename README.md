# Building Web Forms with Next.js Example

This example shows how you can build forms with Next.js.

## Deploy your own

Deploy the example using [Vercel](https://vercel.com?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=next-example) or preview live with [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/github/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/next-forms)

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/git/external?repository-url=https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/next-forms&project-name=next-forms&repository-name=next-forms)

## How to use

Execute [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) with [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/init), [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/create/), or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) to bootstrap the example:

```bash
npx create-next-app --example next-forms next-forms-app
```

```bash
yarn create next-app --example next-forms next-forms-app
```

```bash
pnpm create next-app --example next-forms next-forms-app
```

Deploy it to the cloud with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=next-example) ([Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment)).

Today were going to be using the following core pieces of tech

Overview
Next.JS
Cypress
Vercel
GitHub Actions
For the sake of time, I am going to use a ready to go app provided by Next-JS

Use Next-Forms-App
Clone it down
Install Cypress
Write first test
Configure Base URL
Run test locally
Push this up to the “Main” branch
Now that we have the app, lets deploy it using Vercel.

Set Up Vercel Integration with Repo
Deploy the app
Set up Cypress Dashboard
Configure app locally
Set Up GitHub Actions configuration
Add ENV Vars for Cypress Dashboard
Add Workflow to project
Make sure the workflow is using V4 of Cypress actions
Pull up Cypress Dashboard, Vercel Dashboard and GitHub Actions
Make PR to Main
Watch the magic.
